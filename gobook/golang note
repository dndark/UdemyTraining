Method and Function:
    Method are function. Method is implement some Struct or type
    Ex:
    Func __ methodName returnT {
        Return returnT
    }

Function, Method with pointer
    Function with a pointer argument must past in a pointer.
    Method with a pointer or non-pointer receiver(v or p in the below example) can use either pass in pointer and non-pointer.
    Ex:
    var v Vertex
    ScaleFunc(v)  // Compile error!
    ScaleFunc(&v) // OK

    var v Vertex
    v.Scale(5)  // OK
    p := &v
    p.Scale(10) // OK

Everything in go is passing by VALUE !!
